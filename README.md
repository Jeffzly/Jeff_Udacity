### Project Title
bikeshare110318

### Description
In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### Credits
Below are the review from the Udacity:

:) Hi there! You did an excellent job in this submission. I like your work. Congratulations on completing the project. I wish you all the best in the future study.

Code Quality
All code cells can be run without error.

I ran your codes and there is no error. Good job!

Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.

You used appropriate data types and data structures.

Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.

Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.

Good job in using pandas!

Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.

You used functions.

Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

Script and Questions
Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.

Good job in handling raw input with .lower().

Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.

Good job in computing the descriptive statistics!
You also have the function to display the raw data upon the request of the user.
